# Nyvia Academy

During my coding journey and pursuit of a Bachelor's Degree, I've diligently collected valuable resources and compiled comprehensive notes. Recognizing their worth, I've resolved to organize these materials into a repository and make them accessible to a broader audience.

As time progresses, I intend to expand this repository further, contemplating the possibility of transitioning into video formats to offer concise instructional lessons.

My note-taking endeavor commenced in 2015, coinciding with my initial foray into the world of coding.

## Endgoal
Ultimately, my vision includes the creation of a user-friendly webpage, potentially utilizing tools like **[Nextra.js](https://nextra.site/)** or an **[Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/)**. This platform would empower individuals to conveniently access, fork, and personalize the content to suit their unique preferences and requirements.



## Update 10/24/2023
I am gathering my notes and structuring into proper markdown for the following topics
  
  - [git](https://git-scm.com/) and version control
  - Cheat sheet and configurations for [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
  - Basics with **Debian** based **Linux** Distributives
  - Notes on **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **Java 1.8**, **Java 11**, **Kotlin**, 
  - What are frameworks? **Spring Framework**, 
  - **REST**Ful **API**s, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
  - Software testing, unit and integration tests
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and virtual machines
  - Web Application Security
  - OSI Model, TCP/UDP, HTTP(S), TCP/IP, SSH, DNS, Routers, Switches
  - GNU Privacy Guard ([GPG](https://gnupg.org/)) and encryptions
  - How to deploy web applications with [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)


I am still making notes and sharpening my skills in
- [React.js](https://react.dev/learn)
- [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/docs)

I will put here useful forums/YouTube channels from my bookmarks and notes

I encourage all student and junior developers to extend their expertise beyond software and programming, also delving into topics and concepts related to IT and DevOps.
