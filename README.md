# Nyvia Academy

During my coding journey and pursuit of a Bachelor's Degree, I've diligently collected valuable resources and compiled comprehensive notes. Recognizing their worth, I've resolved to organize these materials into a repository and make them accessible to a broader audience.

As time progresses, I intend to expand this repository further, contemplating the possibility of transitioning into video formats to offer concise instructional lessons.

My note-taking endeavor commenced in 2015, coinciding with my initial foray into the world of coding.

## Endgoal
Ultimately, my vision encompasses the creation of a user-friendly webpage, potentially utilizing tools like **Nextra.js** or an **Obsidian Vault**. This platform would empower individuals to conveniently access, fork, and personalize the content to suit their unique preferences and requirements.
